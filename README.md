# Bandwidth-Monitor
A bandwidth monitor is a tool that is designed to track and measure the amount of data that is being transferred over a network connection in real-time. 
A bandwidth monitoring tool typically works by analyzing network traffic data and providing a detailed report of the amount of data that has been transmitted over the network during a given time period. Some of the key metrics that can be monitored using a bandwidth monitoring tool include:

Network traffic volume: the total amount of data that is being transmitted over the network
Network traffic speed: the rate at which data is being transmitted over the network
Network traffic usage: the amount of bandwidth that is being used by specific applications or devices on the network
